Чтобы предоставить вам эти сведения как можно. I just updated my Windows 8 Mail app and a message popped up saying that Google no longer supports ActiveSync, so I'd have to connect another way (IMAP). Even though Google has discontinued ActiveSync support, existing connections are supposed to continue working. I am a free Google Apps user so I am not 100% sure, but I have to think this means paid Google Apps customers (who still have ActiveSync support from Google) can no longer use ActiveSync in Windows 8 since Microsoft has removed.

WP8 and WP7/5 both did an extremely poor job of supporting Exchange ActiveSync, with large swathes of the protocol that make it useful to businesses being left out or dropped, resulting in a massive regression from Windows Mobile 6.5. Can someone with access to the new emulator poke around and see what elements are available for sync when setting up an Exchange account? I'm particularly interested in whether or not SMS sync to a remote Exchange server is possible again. Thanks.

I can't get the Windows 8.1 Mail app to work with EAS. Here is the error message before Bitlocker finished encrypting. I can't seem to set the device security policies through GPO to match the default EAS security policy. If I grant the user account administrative privileges, the mail app will make the necessary changes, but it won't list which changes are made. Is there anyway around this, does anyone know which security settings in GPO correspond to the default. Заметка для себя. Парочка способов конвертации байтов в строку битов.

I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have an email account with Exchange ActiveSync activated. I am using the native Metro Mail app on a laptop running Windows 8 Pro. I have had an honestly awful experience. Currently, the app decided today to stop syncing my emails. I have gotten no new emails, and if I hit F5 within the app it just says "Syncing" forever. However, my mail works fine in the browser client and on my phone. I have tried to force quit the application Скачать Шахматы 1.4. Freeware, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10.

Hey, I've got a user saying that when he deletes an email from his iPhone using the Outlook app, it isn't being synced to OWA or Outlook on his Mac. I figured that was a bit of a strange issue, since he is able to receive/send email from his iPhone just fine. When he tries in reverse and deletes from Outlook/OWA, it is updated on his iPhone. I enabled ActiveSync logging for about an hour on his phone and asked him to try again so I could see what was going on. He says he tried again to delete. New in Kerio Connect 9.2 Kerio Antivirus.

I'm on the IT staff for my company. We're running Exchange Server 2010 SP3 and I'm a admin. (My job is not related to Exchange, but we make all of our IT staff admins) I can't get email to work on my iPhone in Outlook, but our users have no issues. Here's what I know: Exchange Server 2010 SP3 on Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Organization Configuration - Exchange ActiveSync Mailbox Policies: Allow non-provisionable Devices: Yes Require Password (Device Password Required): PROMT Professional 8.0 — это бизнес-решение с расширенным набором настроек для точного перевода документов по различным тематикам (деловых контрактов, технических описаний, финансовых и других. Hi everyone, This week we have had two separate customers have all of their end users suddenly lose connection to Exchange from their Outlook mobile app (Outlook for Android or iOS). And I really am struggling to figure it out. https://autodiscover. domain /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml successfully prompts for credentials nmap shows TCP 443 as open Tried downgrading app version but get the same issue other Activesync apps work fine (Gmail, Nine, Huawei mail) Outlook desktop works. Hey everyone i hope i can get some help here. I have been butting my head against the wall for about 5 and a half hours now over this one. Sorry if my phrasing is a bit off, but english is not my mother tongue and i am pretty frustrated right now. First of all some background: The firm i am at now is a software development house with around 50 people. I was hired last year as a second sysadmin and am sort of a jack of all trades. The sole sysadmin at the time was hugely overworked Hi, all. Exchange 2010 on premisis. We've got a user whose mail is all getting forwarded or redirected (original message hits his inbox, new outbound message does not get "FW:" prepended to it) to his personal AOL account. He had set up a rule to do this a few years back, but thought he deleted it after his return to work. Message tracking log shows the source of the outbound message as MAILBOXRULE. I can't find this rule anywhere. Get-InboxRule shows nothing. Outlook shows no rules. Hello, I'm looking for a software to ban (for a few minutes) an IP after a few unsuccessful login attempts (owa, activesync, smtp TLS etc.) the goal is to prevent an AD lockout of the account targeted by taking action before the AD policy threshold. On linux, I could run fail2ban with apache or postfix filters, but on Windows, I'm not sure what to use. I've heard about wail2ban (fail2ban for windows) but I'm not sure it's a good idea. Any opinion. 
###Build Help/Ready: What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. Looking for a gaming machine that can do 1440p on high(ish) settings and get at least 60FPS for current games. I don't do content creation, or anything like that, so multi-threaded performance is not very important to me. If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings) 1440p, at least 60FPS (ideally higher), high(ish) settings. I'm running Kerio Connect (mail server) and have port 25, 80 and 443 configured. In front of the mail server is a cloud based anti-spam filter so the MX records are set to the filter and not the actual Kerio Connect server. The anti-spam filter uses port 25 to send and receive mail to the Kerio Connect server. Port 80 and 443 is used for webmail and ActiveSync. There is no pop or imap allowed. At the moment I'm trying to setup CloudFlare. I know CloudFlare does not support We're trying to put Duo in place for our O365 Tenant. (Exchange 2013 Hybrid currently) We have it in place on a bunch of other applications, but I'm having difficulty with this one integration. We have Duo in place on our ADFS Farm using the Duo MFA Adapter. We recently upgraded our ADFS Farm to 2016, and with that came the new Access Control Policies, instead of using Inssuance Claim Rules. ACP's also include setting policies for MFA, which used to be something separate. All of Duo's. 
Background info:- Client e-mail is in Office 365 (E3)- (mobile) Device management is done through Intune.- No on-prem (or Azure) e-mail or SCCM or something like that. Yesterday (almost) all of our clients users got an e-mail message saying that their mobile device was quarentined, and therefore acces to Exchange ActiveSync on that device was blocked until the administrator would allow their device / release them from quarantine. This was a strange message because all our (mobile. This might be a super specific bit of praise, but it's fresh on my mind as our company is moving our email into O365/Exchange Online. Microsoft Modern Authentication (ADAL/OAuth 2.0) is going to be a hard requirement for our clients' authentication, as we are killing off legacy protocols/clients via Azure AD Conditional Access policies and integrating our existing Duo 2FA also via Conditional Access. (Which means no app-specific password capability) So that pretty much limits us to Outlook Hi all, Saw some new reports of a new attack vector on O365, Currently looking into auditing my tenants and I would advise you do the same. Be aware though as MFA is not enough to protect you from this attack as it can be bypassed for Exchange Web Services / ActiveSync if you do not have Modern Authentication.

Looking for some help on this issue we've recently been having, that we've feel like exhausted most options. Let me preface this a bit: OS's affected: Windows 7. Outlook o365 Version: 1810 Issue: Systems will be running outlook fine for most of the day, until suddenly it will stop sending or receiving emails. At this point Outlook will say "Trying to connect", but will never connect, nor prompt for credentials. Things we have Tried: Close and Reopen Outlook I gave Android an honest go at becoming my daily driver over the past 2 weeks, purchasing a Nokia 6.1 with PURE Vanilla Android. My thought process was that my opinion of Android was skewed because I had old hardware and software layers on top of the OS which was bogging down my experience. I installed ONLY Play Store apps that were very well known. Cloud Player, YouTube Music, OneDrive, Edge, Weather Apps, etc. No sideloading of any APKs or anything. The phone worked great for the first We are getting ready to start rolling out Windows 10 to our company and are having a bit of an issue that I wanted to see if there was a better solution for. Historically (Windows 7) we have always kept our computers locked down so that only the person we assigned a computer to could log into it. The way we have done this in Windows 7 was to remove the "NT Authority\Authenticated Users" and "NT Authority\Interactive" groups from the local users group membership and replaced Back in good old days there was the iPhone configuration utility by Apple for Mac OS and Windows (!!) and I was able to create the profiles I needed. Then Apple decided that they will no longer support this tool. I use several Activescny capable systems (e.g. Kopano aka Zarafa or Kerio Connect) and I protect them with HA Proxy with client certificates. Unlike Exchange for those systems there is no iOS provisioning service. For my Android users this is no problem but what to do with iOS? Actives. 
I’ve been scratching my head with this problem for far too long now. The thing is, everything works fine with HAp and Exchange 2013 EXCEPT Outlook (2016) for MAC. In other words, the EWS protocol in Exchange seem to have problems with my config file and I can’t figure out why. If I start Outlook for Mac it works just fine for a minute or two, but after that I just get disconnected from the Exchange server. I then get automatically connected again for a while, and the same thing happens Exchange 2010 Standalone. Updated from Update Rollup 19 to 21. OWA and ActiveSync work fine. When attempting to access ECP it will just spin until the page just times out. No errors during the update. Ran the msp file as admin \(Opened cmd window as admin and ran the update\). Can't find anything in the Event Logs or IIS logs that stands out. Should I try running updatecas.ps1? Any other suggestions or things I should check.
